It excites me to learn cutting-edge technologies and innovative concepts. I enjoy coding and experimenting with ideas. New technology is never a barrier to take on a new challenge.\n\nGraduated from a STEM high school with experience in deep learning and basic science research. Along the way, I have built skills in signal processing and various technology stacks. Now, I'm studying Medicine and Engineering to learn what they offer to solve and inspire. I have worked on several projects aimed at bridging technology gaps to benefit health. I believe AI will benefit medicine, and understanding related fields like neuroscience may offers insights for building efficient AI systems, creating a reciprocal relationship that drives innovation."
